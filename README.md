# Databases Project 2

Question 1 should be done. Still need to populate the tables with rows.

When numbers are given as arguments to the procedure for question 5 they are converted to strings and still added. Not sure if
that should work that way.

Question 2 says we **need** to implement 8 functions or procedures for each table. Might be worth asking him if one function still
works
